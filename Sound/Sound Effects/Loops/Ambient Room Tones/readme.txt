As much as possible, try to have the room tones have a wide radius of audibility. The player should be able to (barely) hear one room tone basically everywhere. Bonus points if you can get RoomToneLoop-004 playing specifically near the exit. If not, no worries, you can just have them play like any other location-based sound (just maybe boost the volume on these a little bit if that's the case)!
